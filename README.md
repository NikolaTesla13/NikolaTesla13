### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who really likes to mess up with new technologies!

    ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a video editor in C, follow me for updates!

    ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning video editing.

    ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects, especially game engines!

    ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with GUI in C.

    ðŸ’¬ Ask me about low level stuff.
    
    ðŸ“« How to reach me on the web:
      - Reddit: u/NikolaTesla13
      - Discord: NikolaTesla13#2601
      - YouTube: Stefan Asandei (better stuff coming soon!)
      
     ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he
     
     âš¡ Fun fact: I code more easily in C than CSS!
